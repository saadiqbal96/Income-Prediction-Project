## 🚀 How to Run

### Using Jupyter or Google Colab
1. Open **`ProjectNotebook.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or upload to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Run all cells in order.  
3. The notebook will:
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset  
   - Implement naive predictor for benchmarking  
   - Train multiple supervised learning models  
   - Tune the optimal model using grid search  
   - Evaluate performance and display accuracy/F1 scores  
   - Analyze feature importance and effects of feature selection  

---

### 📊 Output

- **Exploration Statistics:** number of records, individuals with income >50K, <=50K, and percentage >50K  
- **Naive Predictor:** benchmark accuracy and F1 score  
- **Model Performance:** accuracy/F1 for all trained models, including optimized model  
- **Top Features:** ranked by importance and visualized
